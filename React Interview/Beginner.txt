What is state in React?, State of a component is an object that holds information that may change over the lifetime of the component. When state changes the component re-renders via 'reconciliation' - as such it is recommended to make our state as simple as possible
What if we call setState multiple times within the same synchronous context?, React will attempt to batch these multiple state updates into a single re-rendering process thereby only performing one re-rendering iteration- optiziming the rendering process
Using state how does React determine what to update on the DOM?, React's reconciliation algorithm determines the differences between the previous and new virtual DOM thereby only updating the necessary parts of the actual DOM to reflect the new state efficiently
What are props?, Props are data objects we pass down into children components. When the parent component updates those props it can trigger re-rendering of the child component with those updated values
