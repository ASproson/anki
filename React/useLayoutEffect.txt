What is useLayoutEffect?, It is a version of useEffect that fires before the browser repaints the screen
What does useLayoutEffect do?, It allows us to perform side-effects in a way that is synchronous with the rendering of our components - so before the browser paints the screen
When is useLayoutEffect used?, Most components don't need to know their position and size on the screen to decide what to render; they just return some JSX. After that, the browser calculates their layout and repaints. But for things like tooltips that not enough as it could be above the element and not fit and then appear below. In order to render the tooltip corrrectly we need to know its height. To do this we render in two passes: render tooltip anywhere; measure its height and decide where to place it; then render the tooltip again in the correct place. All of this needs to happen before the browser repaints the screen otherwise the the tooltip visibly move for the user
