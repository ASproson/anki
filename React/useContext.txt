What is useContext?, useContext is a React Hook that lets us read and subscribe to context from our component. It allows us to store information in a globally accessible place in our app
Does the context contain data?, Context itself does not hold the information, but rather it represents the kind of information you can provide or read from other components
What is the state of the data inside of the context?, The context data is always kept up-to-date as React automatically re-renders components that read some context if it changes
