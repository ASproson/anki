What is useContext?, useContext is a React Hook that lets us read and subscribe to context from our component. It allows us to store information in a globally accessible place in our app
Does the context contain data?, Context itself does not hold the information but rather it represents the kind of information you can provide or read from other components
What is the state of the data inside of the context?, The context data is always kept up-to-date as React automatically re-renders components that read some context if it changes
What is the difference between useContext and the traditional method of passing data down through props?,Passing props requires that a parent pass data to its children. In big applications that can lead to prop drilling; this is where props are passed to children simply so that they can pass them down again without strictly making use of them. Context allows us to elevate data to a more global state thereby allowing us to interact with data without having to follow the pattern of parents passing data down through children until it reaches the required point
