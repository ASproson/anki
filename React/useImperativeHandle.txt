What is useImperativeHandle?, It is a React Hook that allows a child component to expose specific functions or properties to its parent component through a ref object
How do we set up useImperativeHandle?, We define the child component as a forwardRef which allows the parent to pass a ref object to the child. Inside the child we call useImperativeHandle where we expose this function to the parent through the ref object
How do we use the ref object from useImperativeHandle in the parent?, We create a ref object and pass it to the child component via props; we can then use this ref to call the function from the parent component
When should we use useImperativeHandle?, The primary use case is when a child needs to expose certain functions/properties to its parent but its not appropriate to pass these through props. For example the child may be a complex UI element that needs to be managed by its own internal state but may also have certain public functions that can be called via the parent
How often should we use useImperativeHandle?, Very sparingly and it should be considered a last resort only when other options such as props, contextn and callback functions are not feasible
